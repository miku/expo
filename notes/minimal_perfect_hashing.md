There is a hash function that can map a keyspace without collisions.
Applicable, if the keyspace is known and fixed.

> Perfect hashing guarantees that you get no collisions at all. -- http://burtleburtle.net/bob/hash/perfect.html

Go library, about 600 SLOC.

> Many constructions for perfect hash functions are known.
