The [read](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/read.2.html#NOTES) syscall:

> On Linux, read() (and similar system calls) will transfer at most 0x7ffff000
> (2,147,479,552) bytes, returning the number of bytes actually transferred.
> (This is true on both 32-bit and 64-bit systems.)

## unexplored optimization techniques

* using `io_uring` w/ Go
* simd
* read, pread, preadv

The calls: https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/readv.2.html

## Perfect hash map

CHD, but its a read only thing; https://github.com/alecthomas/mph?tab=readme-ov-file#what-is-this-useful-for

## The numbers

* range: -99.9 to 99.9
* int variant: -999 to 999

## Maps

* avoid map growth by preallocating space for e.g. 413 cities

## String interning

We have 413 unique keys, we do not need new objects all the time: https://artem.krylysov.com/blog/2018/12/12/string-interning-in-go/
